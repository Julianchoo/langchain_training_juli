      " It is possible to make a living as an artist, although it is not as easy as writing software.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the summer, the protagonist received an invitation to take an entrance exam at the Accademia in Florence.

The protagonist then set out to learn Italian in preparation for the exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This entrance exam was only for foreign students, and it may have been a way to limit the number of stranieri studying art in Florence. The author was in good shape with painting and drawing from the RISD foundation, but they don't know how they passed the written exam. They answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne.\n",
      "\n",

      "This essay question was answered by writing about Cezanne, and the writer used their limited vocabulary to the fullest extent to make the most of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      " At age 25, the narrator has already experienced disappointment in the educational system, this time at the Accademia's painting department. The students and faculty were friendly, but had come to an agreement where the faculty would not teach and the students would not require it.\n",
      "\n",
      " A 19th century atelier was recreated, complete with a stove and a nude model, but only one student painted her while the others chatted or occasionally painted.\n",

      " A model was discovered to live nearby, and she made money by modelling and creating replicas of old paintings for an antique dealer. The dealer would then age the copies to make them look authentic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While studying at the Accademia, the author began painting still lives in their bedroom at night, using small scraps of canvas due to financial constraints. Painting still lives is different from painting people, as the subject cannot move, and people can only sit still for a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      " Painting people requires knowledge of how to paint a generic person and then modify it to match the specific person. Still life painting requires more than just copying what is seen, as it should be filtered through the artist's head to emphasize visual cues and create an interesting painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to create paintings that are more realistic than photographs by emphasizing certain details, such as the sudden change in color at the edge of an object. This can be done in a way that conveys more information than a photograph.\n",
      "\n",
      " Painting still lives allowed the author to become more aware of the details of everyday life that are usually processed unconsciously. This awareness was a refreshing change from the everyday, where noticing such details would be distracting.\n",
      "\n",
      " When painting or writing about something ordinary, it is important to look closely and take the time to notice the details. Even after days of trying to capture the subject, there can still be new things to discover.\n",

      "\n",
      "The narrator tried a new way of painting, taught by professor Ulivi, and received a good grade. However, the Accademia was not teaching the narrator anything useful, so they returned to the US after the first year.\n",
      "\n",
      " After realizing that RISD was too expensive, the narrator decided to get a job at Interleaf, a software company that created documents, to save money for a year before returning to RISD. Through this job, the narrator learned that low end software can often overtake high end software. Despite this, Interleaf still had a few years of life left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interleaf had created a Lisp-based scripting language, and were looking for a Lisp hacker to write in it. The author was a bad employee, as they didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, so they never understood the software.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was not good at software and was irresponsible, which caused friction with their employer. They spent the end of the year secretly working on a book they had a contract to publish, On Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      " The narrator was able to save enough money from their job in Florence to pay off their college loans and return to RISD. They were paid more than four times their daily budget of $7 per hour, allowing them to save and pay off their loans.\n",
      "\n",
      " At Interleaf, the author learned that technology companies should be run by product people, not sales people, and that too many people editing code leads to bugs. They also learned that cheap office space can be depressing, planned meetings are not as effective as corridor conversations, and big, bureaucratic customers can be a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      " Big bureaucratic customers can be a risky source of income, and the best times and places for hacking do not necessarily align with traditional office hours and locations.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the importance of being the \"entry level\" option in order to avoid being squashed by competitors. It also suggests that prestige is a warning sign and should be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      " After leaving RISD, the narrator arranged to do freelance work for a group that did projects for customers. On a later visit, someone told the narrator about a new markup language called HTML, which the narrator initially ignored. However, HTML eventually became a major part of the narrator's life.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 1992, the narrator moved back to Providence to attend RISD, expecting to experience a more serious art school than the intro classes and the Accademia. However, they found that the painting department at RISD was not much different from the Accademia, and did not provide the same level of education as medical school did for medicine.\n",

YC then focuses intensively on helping the startups for three months.\n",

      "This deal for startups was based on a combination of a previous deal with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). The investment was $6k per founder, totaling $12k in return for 6%. This was considered fair because it was twice as good as the deal the investors had taken.

      "\n",
      " As Y Combinator (YC) grew, the alumni community became more tightly knit and dedicated to helping each other, especially the current batch. Additionally, the startups began to become customers of one another, leading to the creation of the \"YC GDP\" joke. As YC continues to grow, this joke is becoming less and less of a reality as many startups are now getting their initial set of customers almost entirely from their batchmates.\n",

      "Hacker News (HN) was beneficial for Y Combinator (YC), but it was also the biggest source of stress for the speaker. If the speaker's only job was to select and help founders, life would have been much easier. This suggests that HN was a mistake, as the biggest source of stress should be related to the core of the work. The speaker felt like they were in pain while running a marathon, not from the exertion of running, but from an ill-fitting shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      " This anecdote illustrates the prevalence of Hacker News (HN) in the Y Combinator (YC) startup ecosystem, with about a 60% chance that any urgent problem encountered was related to HN.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc, but gradually stopped working on it due to lack of time and the infrastructure depending on it. The author's three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\n",
      "\n",
      " Working at YC was a unique experience, as the problems of the startups in each batch became the team's problems. It was an engaging and educational experience, as the founders were effective and the problems varied. It was an ideal way to learn about startups quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker worked hard at their job, even the parts they didn't like, motivated by a quote from Kevin Hale that the boss sets the upper bound for how hard everyone else works. The speaker wanted YC to be good, so they worked hard to make it happen.\n",

The speaker realized that Rtm was rarely wrong, and began to think that if they continued on their current trajectory, YC would consume all of their attention and become their life's work.\n",

      " The speaker realized that their life's work was not at YC, so they had to eventually leave.\n",

      " In 2012, my mother had a stroke caused by colon cancer, and was put in a nursing home. My sister and I wanted to help her get back to her house, so I started flying up to Oregon to visit her regularly. On one of these flights, I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n",

However, after persistent persuasion, he eventually agreed in October 2013 and began taking over the running of Y Combinator in preparation for the winter 2014 batch. Meanwhile, the original president was focusing on his mother's cancer, which had returned.\n",

The protagonist then set out to learn Italian in preparation for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This entrance exam was only for foreign students, and it may have been a way to limit the number of stranieri studying art in Florence.

    "This essay question was answered by writing about Cezanne, and the writer used their limited vocabulary to the fullest extent to make the most of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    " At age 25, the narrator has already experienced disappointment in the educational system, this time at the Accademia's painting department. The students and faculty were friendly, but had come to an agreement where the faculty would not teach and the students would not require it.\n",
    "\n",
    " A 19th century atelier was recreated, complete with a stove and a nude model, but only one student painted her while the others chatted or occasionally painted.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While studying at the Accademia, the author began painting still lives in their bedroom at night, using small scraps of canvas due to financial constraints. Painting still lives is different from painting people, as the subject cannot move, and people can only sit still for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    " Painting people requires knowledge of how to paint a generic person and then modify it to match the specific person. Still life painting requires more than just copying what is seen, as it should be filtered through the artist's head to emphasize visual cues and create an interesting painting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to create paintings that are more realistic than photographs by emphasizing certain details, such as the sudden change in color at the edge of an object. This can be done in a way that conveys more information than a photograph.\n",
    "\n",
    " Painting still lives allowed the author to become more aware of the details of everyday life that are usually processed unconsciously. This awareness was a refreshing change from the everyday, where noticing such details would be distracting.\n",
    "\n",
    " When painting or writing about something ordinary, it is important to look closely and take the time to notice the details. Even after days of trying to capture the subject, there can still be new things to discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrator tried a new way of painting, taught by professor Ulivi, and received a good grade. However, the Accademia was not teaching the narrator anything useful, so they returned to the US after the first year.\n",
    "\n",
    " After realizing that RISD was too expensive, the narrator decided to get a job at Interleaf, a software company that created documents, to save money for a year before returning to RISD. Through this job, the narrator learned that low end software can often overtake high end software. Despite this, Interleaf still had a few years of life left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaf had created a Lisp-based scripting language, and were looking for a Lisp hacker to write in it. The author was a bad employee, as they didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, so they never understood the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker was not good at software and was irresponsible, which caused friction with their employer. They spent the end of the year secretly working on a book they had a contract to publish, On Lisp.\n",
    "\n",
    " The narrator was able to save enough money from their job in Florence to pay off their college loans and return to RISD. They were paid more than four times their daily budget of $7 per hour, allowing them to save and pay off their loans.\n",
    "\n",
    " At Interleaf, the author learned that technology companies should be run by product people, not sales people, and that too many people editing code leads to bugs. They also learned that cheap office space can be depressing, planned meetings are not as effective as corridor conversations, and big, bureaucratic customers can be a challenge.\n",

    " After leaving RISD, the narrator arranged to do freelance work for a group that did projects for customers. On a later visit, someone told the narrator about a new markup language called HTML, which the narrator initially ignored. However, HTML eventually became a major part of the narrator's life.\n",
    "\n",
    " In 1992, the narrator moved back to Providence to attend RISD, expecting to experience a more serious art school than the intro classes and the Accademia. However, they found that the painting department at RISD was not much different from the Accademia, and did not provide the same level of education as medical school did for medicine.\n",

    " Working on something that is not prestigious can be a sign that there is something real to be discovered and that you have the right motives. Impure motives can lead to being misguided, so it is important to be aware of the desire to impress people. Working on something that is not prestigious does not guarantee that you are on the right track, but it is worth considering.\n",

    " This statement suggests that while taking a certain approach may not guarantee success, it can help to avoid common mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    " Over the next few years, the author wrote many essays, which were later published as a book called Hackers & Painters. They also worked on spam filters and did more painting. They also hosted weekly dinners for friends, which taught them how to cook for groups. Finally, they bought a former candy factory (and later, a porn studio) to use as an office.\n",

    " Julian and the founders had experienced the helplessness of not knowing how to get a company set up with bylaws, stock, and other investments. They wanted to help other founders in the same way Julian had helped them, so they created a plan to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    " This statement is about a plan to make seed investments and to provide the same level of support to startups that was given to the speaker's own venture.\n",
    "\n",
    " Y Combinator was not initially organized as a fund, but was instead funded with the founders' own money. This was not due to any particular insight, as the founders were unaware of how VC firms were organized and would not have known where to start if they had considered raising a fund.\n",
    "\n",
    " Y Combinator (YC) is a venture capital firm that funds startups twice a year in batches. This model was discovered by accident due to their inexperience in investing, and was inspired by the idea of undergrads getting temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. YC then focuses intensively on helping the startups for three months.\n",
    "\n",
    " This proposal suggests organizing a summer program where students would start their own startups instead of working at tech companies. This would give students an interesting summer experience and provide investors with a chance to practice their skills.\n",

    "The SFP project was becoming more serious than expected, as many applicants were either recent graduates or were graduating that spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Y Combinator's first batch of funded startups included Reddit, Twitch, and Aaron Swartz, who later became a martyr for open access. Sam Altman, who later became the second president of YC, was also part of the group. It is believed that the success of the first batch was not entirely luck, but rather due to the boldness of the founders.\n",
    "\n",
    " The Summer Founders Program was a bold choice for the first batch of participants, as it was a unique opportunity compared to more traditional summer jobs at companies like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This deal for startups was based on a combination of a previous deal with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). The investment was $6k per founder, totaling $12k in return for 6%. This was considered fair because it was twice as good as the deal the investors had taken. Additionally, Jessica provided the founders with free air conditioners during the hot summer.\n",

    "This article discusses the benefits of batch funding for startups. Batch funding is more convenient for investors, but it also provides a sense of community and support for founders, who no longer have to face their problems in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    " As Y Combinator (YC) grew, the alumni community became more tightly knit and dedicated to helping each other, especially the current batch. Additionally, the startups began to become customers of one another, leading to the creation of the \"YC GDP\" joke. As YC continues to grow, this joke is becoming less and less of a reality as many startups are now getting their initial set of customers almost entirely from their batchmates.\n",
    "\n",

    " In 2006, Robert and the speaker began working on a new version of Arc, which was compiled into Scheme and was faster than the previous version. To test it, the speaker wrote a news aggregator called Startup News, but changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to reach future startup founders instead of current ones.\n",
    "\n",
    " The name of a website was changed to Hacker News and the topic was changed to whatever interested the user intellectually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News (HN) was beneficial for Y Combinator (YC), but it was also the biggest source of stress for the speaker. If the speaker's only job was to select and help founders, life would have been much easier. This suggests that HN was a mistake, as the biggest source of stress should be related to the core of the work. The speaker felt like they were in pain while running a marathon, not from the exertion of running, but from an ill-fitting shoe.\n",
    "\n",
    " This anecdote illustrates the prevalence of Hacker News (HN) in the Y Combinator (YC) startup ecosystem, with about a 60% chance that any urgent problem encountered was related to HN.\n",
    "\n",
    " The author wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc, but gradually stopped working on it due to lack of time and the infrastructure depending on it. The author's three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\n",
    "\n",
    " Working at YC was a unique experience, as the problems of the startups in each batch became the team's problems. It was an engaging and educational experience, as the founders were effective and the problems varied. It was an ideal way to learn about startups quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    " The speaker worked hard at their job, even the parts they didn't like, motivated by a quote from Kevin Hale that the boss sets the upper bound for how hard everyone else works. The speaker wanted YC to be good, so they worked hard to make it happen.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010, Robert Morris gave the speaker unsolicited advice while they were in California for interviews. This was only the second time Morris had ever done this, the first being when he offered to take the speaker to the hospital when they were suffering from a kidney stone. His exact words were \"You know, you should make sure Y Combinator isn't\".\n",

Meanwhile, the original president was focusing on his mother's cancer, which had returned.\n",

    "\n",
    "\" John McCarthy developed Lisp as a model of computation, but it wasn't until his graduate student Steve Russell suggested it could be used to program computers that it became a programming language. Lisp's power and elegance attracted the author in college, though they didn't understand why at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    " John McCarthy's 1960 Lisp interpreter was missing many features of a programming language, so they had to be added. However, McCarthy's original axiomatic approach was not feasible, so he tested the interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. Unfortunately, this method was close to its limit, and a bug was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "John McCarthy had overlooked a bug in his interpreter, so a more complicated interpreter had to be tested by running it, but computers at the time were not powerful enough to do so.\n",

    " The author wrote a new Lisp language called Bel, which was written in Arc. To make this work, the author had to use a collection of hacks to create an interpreter that could run, albeit not very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    " In late 2015, the author spent three months writing essays and when they returned to working on Bel, a self-interpreting code, they found it difficult to understand due to its complexity. Errors were difficult to decipher due to the multiple levels of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    " Paul Graham had been working on a project called Bel for years, but kept it a secret from most people. During this time, he was working harder than ever, but people on Twitter and Hacker News would ask if he was still coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The author worked intensively on Bel, a coding project, and was able to keep a decent chunk of the code in their head. On a sunny day in 2015, the author took their children to the coast and worked on a problem involving continuations while watching them play in the tide pools. This experience was novel and made the author feel like they were doing life right.\n",

    " After being able to write essays again, the author wrote a bunch of essays on topics they had been wanting to write about. They then started to think about other things they could work on and wrote an essay to answer the question of how they had chosen what to work on in the past. They thought that this essay might be interesting to other people.\n",
    "\n",
    " This sentence is the conclusion of a more detailed version of a story that is meant to be interesting and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.\n",
    "\n",
    " The author skipped the step of using time-sharing machines with interactive OSes and went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made the latter more exciting.\n",
    "\n",
    " Italian words for abstract concepts are usually predictable from their English equivalents, but everyday words differ. By combining abstract concepts with simple verbs, one can make a small amount of Italian go a long way.\n",

They started a company to build an application service provider (ASP) which was later renamed Aspra.
